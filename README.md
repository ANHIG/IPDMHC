This branch represents the IPD-MHC FTP directory prior to the rebuild in 2018.

IPD-MHC Sequence Database - README File

This directory contains data for the IPD-MHC Sequence Database. The IPD-MHC
sequence database provides a centralised repository for sequences of the major
histocompatibilty complex from a number of different species. Through a number
of international collaborations IPD is able to provide the MHC sequences of
different species. The sequences provided by each group are curated by experts
in the field and then submitted to the central database.

The FTP directory is further divided by group as follows:

bola: Cattle
dla:  Canine
fish: Fish
fla:  Feline
nhp:  Non-human primates
ovar: Sheep
rt1:  Rat
sla:  Swine

The files all use the following naming convention:

species.locus.type.format - so for a FASTA formatted file of Gogo-A nucleotide
sequences the file name would be gogo.a.nuc.fasta located in the nhp directory.

Updated: 15 January 2004,  Release 1.0.0
Updated: 17 November 2004, Release 1.0.1
Updated: 24 February 2006, Release 1.1.0

Files are currently provided for the nucleotide and protein sequences in FASTA or
PIR format.
